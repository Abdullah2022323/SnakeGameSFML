# SnakeGameSFML
This is the simplest snake game you can find on the internet.
This is developed by using SFML library in C++.
There are addresses to the files in the loadFromFile lines, please replace them with the addresses to the files
where you have saved them, otherwise the game will not run.
This is intended for personal use only and not for any commercial use.
Thank you for reading.
